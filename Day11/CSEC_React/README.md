## Steps I Followed
1. Set up a new React project.
2. Created a simple component and rendered it.
3. Used the `useState` hook to manage component state.
4. Passed data to child components using props.
5. Built a small application to practice these concepts.

## Task Details
- Created a page.
- Created reusable components.
- Styled the components using CSS/Tailwind.
