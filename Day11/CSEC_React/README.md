# Project: React, Tailwind, and Vite Setup

In this project, I set up a modern development environment using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. React was used for building the user interface, while Tailwind CSS provided utility-first styling for faster design implementation. Vite was chosen as the build tool due to its speed and efficient development experience.

I created a basic React application, styled it with Tailwind CSS, and used Vite for fast hot module reloading and optimized builds. This setup allows for a smooth and productive development workflow, making it easier to build, style, and deploy web applications.

By the end of this task, I have a basic understanding of how to create and manage components in a React application.
